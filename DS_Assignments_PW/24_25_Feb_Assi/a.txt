You are given a CSV file containing student data that includes the student ID and their test score. Write a Python program that reads the CSV file, calculates the mean, median, and mode of the test scores, and displays the results in a table.

 The program should do the following:

    - Prompt the user to enter the file path of the CSV file containing the student data.
    - Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the test scores using Pandas tools.
    - Display the mean, median, and mode in a table.

 Assume the CSV file contains the following columns.
    - Student ID: The ID of the student.
    - Test Score: The score of the student's test.

 Example usage of the program:
 Enter the file path of the CSV file containing the student data: student_data.csv 

 +-----------+--------+
 | Statistic | Value  |
 +-----------+--------+
 | Mean      | 79.6   |
 | Median    | 82     |
 | Mode      | 85, 90 |
 +-----------+--------+

 The program should calculate the mean, median, and mode of the test scores and display the results in a table.
